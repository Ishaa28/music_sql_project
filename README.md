# Music_SQL_Project

Music Database SQL Analysis Project
This project showcases advanced SQL data exploration and reporting on a relational music database (modeled after the classic Chinook/record store schema).

Project Highlights
Analyzes business and music insights using complex joins, subqueries, window functions, and aggregation.

#Answers practical business and analytical questions, such as:

Top customers and cities by revenue,
Most invoiced countries and best customers,
Most popular genres per country,
Top artists by track count and by customer spend,
Deep-dive on rock genre listeners,
Advanced groupings, including "top per country" queries using window functions,
Queries suitable for PostgreSQL and compatible relational databases.

#Key SQL Topics Practiced
Multi-table joins (INNER JOIN, implicit joins)

Aggregation (SUM, COUNT, MAX)

Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, PARTITION BY)

Filtering (WHERE, HAVING)

Ranking and top-N analysis (with LIMIT, ORDER BY)

Data grouping and grouping by calculated fields
